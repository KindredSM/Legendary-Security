        <p class="testimonial__text">“With a myriad of options to choose from, there was always the temptation to hire freelance security staff until I realised that most of the personnel were not suitably insured or adequately trained. I decided to recruit Legendary Security for my door supervision requirements and now I can rest easy knowing that their staff are entirely professional, reliable and are great with my customers. For the continued support I receive they are also great value for money.”<br><br>
