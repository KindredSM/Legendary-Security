          <p class="testimonial__text">“In the past, there was always a real temptation to employ freelance security staff at my restaurant/bar and for my events (at a lesser cost) until I realised that the majority of the personnel were not properly trained or suitably insured. I got wise and recruited Legendary Security for my door supervision requirements and now I have the peace of mind of knowing that they are totally professional and reliable and are great with my customers. For the support services I get, they are also very good value for money.”<br><br>
